# Finger-Tracking-Application
Detects and tracks hand movements and counts the number of fingers a user is holding up via webcam.  

## Installation
For this application to function, make sure to install MediaPipe (for hand-tracking software) and opencv-python (for webcam access).
```
pip install mediapipe
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
The file `/src/app.py` can be downloaded and run in an IDE such as PyCharm or VS Code. The file `/src/hand_tracking_module.py` defines a class consisting of the funcionality of the `app.py` file.

## TODO
File `hand_tracking_module.py` is a work in progress; it is recommended to use the `app.py` file instead until further notice.
